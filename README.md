# Inventory
A simple CLI program that keeps track of items, the items price, when you purchased it and a small description of it. 
it also works as a checklist. Its my first big project I've completed. I used C# .NET Core 2.2, and SQLite.

This is a prototype. I know it is lacking features. I plan to add more things at a later time. 
What is available right now is what I felt would be a good place to take a break from it.

So to give a summary of Inventory.
Inventory is basically as it sounds, a program that keeps track of an inventory of items you bought.
  -Also act as a checklist,
  -lists can be removed,
  -Lists can be viewed without having to edit them,
  -Multiple lists can exist but cant share the same name,
  -Keeps track of item name, price, date bought, and 300 character description of the item
