# Inventory
A simple CLI program that keeps track of items, the items price, when you purchased it and a small description of it. 
it also works as a checklist. Its my first big project I've completed. I used C# .NET Core 2.2, and SQLite.

this is my first time filling out a readme file so forgive me if this is different than most.
This is what im calling my first big or real project. Its something that actually can be used for task.

This is an uncompleted project. I know it is lacking features. I plan to add more things over time. 
What is available right now is what I felt would be a good place to take a break from it.
I will be adding things in the future. 

So to give a summary of Inventory.
Inventory is basically as it sounds, a program that keeps track of an inventory of items you bought.
  -Also act as a checklist,
  -lists can be removed,
  -Lists can be viewed without having to edit them,
  -Multiple lists can exist but cant share the same name,
  -Keeps track of item name, price, date bought, and 300 character description of the item
  
  more will be added. I havent given up on it. Theres more I like to add like I said but right now 
  Im working on other projects, so I can build a resume for a career, ad so I can practice, 
  and make cool stuff so I can keep improving!
  
  If theres anything you want me to add or think I should add then please tell me! I always want to improve and get better!
  I dont know if this is similar to other readme's but I just thought it should be about the project and its purpose/status.
